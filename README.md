# Udacity Project: Build a Portfolio Site
This is the final project for the Web Foundations portion of the program, requiring me to build a website mockup intended to be my portfolio site using the HTML and CSS taught so far. The project also requires me to consider responsive design and adapt the website for multiple types of devices.


## Getting Started
The root of the project folder contains the main html file with css and image files separated in their own respective folders

#### Installation
No special installation instructions required. Just download the project directory and run index.html on a web browser.

## Contributions
Critiques, feedback, and suggestions on the project will be appreciated!
